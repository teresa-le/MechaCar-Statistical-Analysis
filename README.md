Vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle, and AWD's p-values are more than 0.05 so they likely contribute a random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 

The slope of the linear model is not 0; the slope is the coefficient of the independent variable used to predict the dependent variable. For example, if vehicle_length is being used to predict mpg, then the slope would be 6.267. If vehicle_length increases by 1 and the values of the other independent variables are held constant, then mpg would increase by 6.267.

The linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes pretty effectively. The model can predict 71.49% of the observations in the model. Based on the p-value, we reject the null hypothesis; there is evidence that at least one of the independent variables significantly influences and can predict the dependent variable mpg. 


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

When it comes to all manufacturing lots, the suspension coils currently meet the design specification, which is to have a variance no more than 100 pounds per square inch.

In the table above, the variance for lot 3 is 170.3 pounds per square inch so lot 3 does not meet the design specification.
